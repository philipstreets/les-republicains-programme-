Political debate around policies and programme.
I have been a member of "Les Republicains" for many years and have always been terribly frustrated at the way people misunderstand each other concerning political policies or manipulate specific speeches or comments out of context making concensus almost impossible. There musy be a better way to understand and transmit what people agree on as their basic policies and political programme. 
A political party must be able to take into account the opinions and view points of all its paid up members in drawing up its policies and programme in relation to its basic values and orientations.
The party says clearly who they are and what they stand for and attracted their members on the basis of those values. 
Like minded people come together to form and finance the Party.
Then those members decide together, through debate and discussion the party line and their agreed policies.
Democratic party politics.
