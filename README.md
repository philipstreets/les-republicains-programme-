Political debate around policies and programme.
I have been a member of "Les Republicains" for many years and have always been terribly frustrated at the way people misunderstand each other concerning political policies or manipulate specific speeches or comments out of context making concensus almost impossible. There musy be a better way to understand and transmit what people agree on as their basic policies and political programme.
